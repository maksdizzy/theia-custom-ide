# Configure Python version for node-gyp native module builds
# Python 3.14 removed distutils module which node-gyp still requires
# Using Python 3.10 which has distutils support
# Note: npm v11+ prefers environment variable but accepts this for compatibility
python=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.10

# Alternative: set via environment variable before npm install:
# npm_config_python=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.10 npm install
